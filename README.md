## Content
* **tensorBuilder**: Python scripts to analyse effects of AminoAcid sequences on peptide binding affinity, PCA and wavelet transforms are used. The resulted paper can be seen by thePaper.pdf
* **waveletTrials**: Use of wavelet transform to see its affect over binding affinity
* **thePaper**: The paper about Predicting Peptide Binding Affinity
